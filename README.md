# AI Math Agent

A simple Python-based mathematical agent that performs basic arithmetic operations using the `eval()` function.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Python's `eval()` function to create a basic calculator that can handle simple mathematical expressions.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
- Simple expression evaluation
- Safe handling of mathematical inputs

## Usage

```python
expression = "2 + 2"
result = eval(expression)  # Returns 4
```

## Note

The `eval()` function should be used cautiously as it can execute arbitrary Python code. This implementation is for educational purposes only.
